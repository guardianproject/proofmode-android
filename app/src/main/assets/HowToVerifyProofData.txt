Brief information on how to verify the media file, proof and signatures contained in a ProofMode ZIP file.
Please visit https://proofmode.org or email support@guardianproject.info for more information.

1) Import public key shared from ProofMode:

gpg --import pubkey.asc

gpg: key xxx: public key "noone@proofmode.witness.org" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1

2) Check the hash of the media file against the hash in the proofmetadat:

sha256sum PXL_20220204_035043227.jpg

THEHASHVALUEFORYOURPHOTO  PXL_20220204_035043227.jpg

3) verify signature using actual photo to test GOOD signature

gpg --dearmor pubkey.asc
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring ./pubkey.asc.gpg --homedir ./ --verify THEHASHVALUEFORYOURPHOTO.asc PXL_20220204_035043227.jpg

gpg: Signature made Thu 03 Feb 2022 10:51:16 PM EST
gpg:                using RSA key 560CC828C726365F
gpg: Good signature from "noone@proofmode.witness.org" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 094F 9BAE 1895 8C23 8F55  F793 560C C828 C726 365F

4) verify signature of ProofMode data using actual photo to test GOOD signature

gpg --verify THEHASHVALUEFORYOURPHOTO.proof.csv.asc THEHASHVALUEFORYOURPHOTO.proof.csv
gpg: Signature made Thu 03 Feb 2022 10:51:18 PM EST
gpg:                using RSA key 560CC828C726365F
gpg: Good signature from "noone@proofmode.witness.org" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 094F 9BAE 1895 8C23 8F55  F793 560C C828 C726 365F

5) If a .OTS file is present, you can visit https://opentimestamps.org/ and upload the OTF to verify the notarization
(It can take awhile for the notarization timestamp to make its way fully to the Bitcoin blockchain)

6) If a .GTS file is present, that is a Javascript Web Token signature from Google SafetyNet. You can decode the value of it here: https://jwt.io/
